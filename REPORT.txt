- Why does getchar return an int instead of a char?

In C, characters are represented as ints, as shown by the ASCII table.
The return type of int is also put in place to accomodate for the 
special value End of File (EOF), represented as -1 (int). It is not 
possible to represent the EOF with a value form 0-255, so we must 
change the return type of getchar() to int.


- Why is the 16 byte alignment there for the stack pointer? What will break if
  you ignored that requirement in your code?

The reason there is a standardized 16 byte alignment for a stack pointer is 
so Streaming SIMD Extenstions (SSE) can perform parallel operations on 
multiple words in memory. However, these multiple words need to start at 
an address which is a multiple of 16 bytes. It would simply just be much 
more efficient on the hardware side, if we followed this standard. If we did 
not follow the 16 byte alignment, compiling our code would result in a 
segmentation fault in the x86 Assembly part.
